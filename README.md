# SWDB 2025 Day 4 - Connectomics Workshop

Produced for: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/swdb_2025_student

The function of the nervous system arises out of a combination of the properties of individual neurons and the properties of how they are connected into a larger network. The central goal of <b>connectomics</b> is to produce complete maps of the connectivity of the nervous system with synaptic resolution and analyze them to better understand the organization, development, and function of the nervous system. 

**Electron Microscopy (EM) data enables morphological reconstruction of neurons and resolution of their synaptic connectivity**. The V1DD dataset is one of the largest volume EM datasets currently available, and spans all layers of mouse visual cortex. We will be using this dataset to query the connectivity between neurons in the visual cortex. 

Workshop aims:

* Understand what are the major classes of cell types in cortex
* Understand the basics of how synaptic connectivity is measured in EM connectomics
* Look at the relationship between the structure of networks and cell type connectivity
* Look at the relationship between functional tuning properties of neurons and how they are connected in the network
